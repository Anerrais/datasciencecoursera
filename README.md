# Telecommuting
Telecommuting has been an issue for companies and employees for years. This may seem a little odd, but I've found that by telecommuting I have developed more collaborations and "co-workers"  outside of my work team/department.  When I was working in an office, it seemed that I focused more on team relationships with those who I shared space with.  We went to lunch...we chatted over cube walls...we met for coffee.   While this was beneficial for team building, I have found that by telecommuting a "sameness" in status developed with all those I interact with.  New alliances were formed outside of my department; strengthening my network, my knowledge and ideas outside of my current position, and my view of the "bigger picture".   I also feel that though my supervisor and other team members are hours away, I feel close to them because of our need to listen more intently and to develop methods and ways to develop a "trust" relationship.   Not relying on face-to-face interactions has strengthen my listening skills.  I take more notes, reach out to more folks in other departments and have gained a greater knowledge of total processes and how it relates to me.  I am able to offer more input and assist in ways I didn't feel possible before.  The "box" of the office is gone and now I feel I am a strong member of a larger team that encompasses many departments across my region.
